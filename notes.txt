Seems like it would make sense to be able to select two markers and then
create a distance error between them.  I'm not sure what the interaction
here is though.  The most intuitive thing seems to be right-clicking
on the 3D view and having a context menu which says "Add Distance Error".

I'd like to be able to take an existing body and create another version of
it as a child of another body at the same global location.

* steps
  * Select a body
  * duplicate
  * cut
  * Select another body
  * paste child global
* notes
  * we could potentially select multiple source bodies and multiple target
    bodies and create a copy of each source on each target
  * we can reparent a body by
    * steps
      * select a body
      * cut
      * select another body
      * paste child global
    * We lose any distance errors that are not children of the body this way.
      * If we support having distance errors that are children of bodies, then
        this wouldn't be as big of a problem.
  * having duplicate instead of copy seems a bit better, since we can't
    easily make several copies of a body onto the same parent using just copy
    and paste child global, but we can easily copy a body onto another
    body by using duplicate, cut and paste child global

If we cut a body and paste it, we lose the distance errors.
* We could potentially remember the distance errors that are connected.
  * This might be nice, because we could
* We could allow distance errors to be children of a body.
  * This seems like a good alternative.
  * For this to work without having objects reference later objects, we
    would need to move the markers so that they appear before the bodies.
    * Scene
      * [Marker] global1
      * [Body]
        * [Marker] local1
        * [DistanceError] local1 <-> global1
* We could have a different way of moving a body that doesn't involve removing
  it first.
---
Allow adding distance errors to bodies.
* This will mean removing/adding distance errors to the tree when we
  remove or add bodies.
---
After transferring a marker to a new body, the scene should be re-solved.
---
If we remove a body, the distance error lines need to be updated in the scene.
