Seems like it would make sense to be able to select two markers and then
create a distance error between them.  I'm not sure what the interaction
here is though.  The most intuitive thing seems to be right-clicking
on the 3D view and having a context menu which says "Add Distance Error".

I'd like to be able to take an existing body and create another version of
it as a child of another body at the same global location.

* steps
  * Select a body
  * duplicate
  * cut
  * Select another body
  * paste child global
* notes
  * we could potentially select multiple source bodies and multiple target
    bodies and create a copy of each source on each target
  * we can reparent a body by
    * steps
      * select a body
      * cut
      * select another body
      * paste child global
    * We lose any distance errors that are not children of the body this way.
      * If we support having distance errors that are children of bodies, then
        this wouldn't be as big of a problem.
  * having duplicate instead of copy seems a bit better, since we can't
    easily make several copies of a body onto the same parent using just copy
    and paste child global, but we can easily copy a body onto another
    body by using duplicate, cut and paste child global

If we cut a body and paste it, we lose the distance errors.
* We could potentially remember the distance errors that are connected.
  * This might be nice, because we could
* We could allow distance errors to be children of a body.
  * This seems like a good alternative.
  * For this to work without having objects reference later objects, we
    would need to move the markers so that they appear before the bodies.
    * Scene
      * [Marker] global1
      * [Body]
        * [Marker] local1
        * [DistanceError] local1 <-> global1
* We could have a different way of moving a body that doesn't involve removing
  it first.

Make markers appear before bodies in the scene.
* This is currently awkward, because the TreePaths don't know anything about
  the hiearchy.

What is in the tree should always be a subset of what is in the scene state.
i.e. if we are adding something, we first add it to the scene state, and then
add it to the tree.  If we are removing something, we first remove it from
the tree, then remove it from the scene state.

However, we don't always add one at a time.  Do we always add to the end?
  It seems like when we are adding, we are always adding to the end.
  We never create markers or body in the middle.
If we are removing, we may be removing from the middle.
It only really matters if we use the path.
