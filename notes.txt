Seems like it would make sense to be able to select two markers and then
create a distance error between them.  I'm not sure what the interaction
here is though.  The most intuitive thing seems to be right-clicking
on the 3D view and having a context menu which says "Add Distance Error".

Seems like duplicating a body should also duplicate the markers on the
body and maybe the children as well, but I'm not sure.  What about the
distance errors?  It might seem like the distance errors should be duplicated
as well, but the distance errors are in a separate branch of the tree.

Seems like we shouldn't allow the geometry scale to be negative.
