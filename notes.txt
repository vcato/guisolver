Seems like it would make sense to be able to select two markers and then
create a distance error between them.  I'm not sure what the interaction
here is though.  The most intuitive thing seems to be right-clicking
on the 3D view and having a context menu which says "Add Distance Error".

I'd like to be able to take an existing body and create another version of
it as a child of another body at the same global location.

* steps
  * Select a body
  * duplicate
  * cut
  * Select another body
  * paste child global
* notes
  * this seems like the fewest operations and it also has the advantage that
    we could potentially select multiple source bodies and multiple target
    bodies and create a copy of each source on each target
  * to be able to paste a child either locally or globally, we'll have to
    remember the parent global transform.
  * one interesting thought is that you could always paste another body
    that places the body at the same global position, then the user could
    bake the transform into the children and remove the body if they wanted
    to preserve the global position, or just remove the body if they didn't.
  * we can reparent a body by
    * select a body
    * cut
    * select another body
    * paste child global
  * having duplicate instead of copy seems a bit better, since we can't
    easily make several copies of a body onto the same parent using just copy
    and paste child global, but we can easily copy a body onto another
    body by using duplicate, cut and paste child global

Make removing a body actually be a cut.
* I think we should be extracting a tagged value for the body instead of
  a copy of the Body object and the related Markers.  This helps us abstract
  the way the scene is storing the data.
