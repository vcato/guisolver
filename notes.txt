Allow adding distance errors to bodies.
* This will mean removing/adding distance errors to the tree when we
  remove or add bodies.
* This will make it more natural to think of a body, its markers, and
  its distance errors as a single unit.

Allow loading .obj geometry onto a body.

Have rays.

Class {
  name: "Ray"
  Param {
    name: "origin"
    type: Point
  }
  Param {
    name: "direction"
    type: Vector
  }
  Line {
    start: origin
    end: origin + direction*1000
  }
}
Class {
  name: "PointOnRay"
  Param {
    name: "ray"
    type: Ray
  }
  Param {
    name: "step"
    type: Float
  }
  ray.origin + ray.direction*step
}

Should we have markers as children of rays?

A ray could just be geometry.  It could be an infinite line along the X
axis starting at (0,0,0).  We could change the ray origin and direction
using a body.

Maybe we have a list of rays on a body.

Compiling observed_scene.cpp is slow.
